# = Cinch Voting plugin
# This is a voting plugin for more serious use. It allows
# a specified number of nicks to vote exactly once on a
# given topic, optionally requiring them to be authenticated
# against NickServ in order to be able to vote.
# Multiple votes are supported in parallel, and each vote
# may either be public or covert, where in the latter case
# nobody will be able to see who voted on which option (as
# voting occurs via PM to the bot), but only see the results.
#
# == Dependencies
# None.
#
# == Configuration
# Add the following to your bot’s configure.do stanza:
#
#   config.plugins.options[Cinch::Vote] = {
#     :auth_required => true,
#     :voters => %w[Carlo, n0b0dY]
#   }
#
# [auth_required]
#   If true, the voters must be authenticated against
#   NickServ to be able to exercise their voting right.
#   This is recommended to turn on, because otherwise
#   a simple /nick command is enough to impersonate
#   someone seemingly known just for voting manipulation.
# [voters]
#   List of nicks (array of strings) that are allowed to
#   vote. Before adding to this list, you have to check
#   that the person using this nick is actually the person
#   you think it is.
