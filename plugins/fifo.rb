# = Cinch FIFO plugin
# Create a gateway to IRC on your filesystem! This Cinch
# plugin creates a named pipe (a FIFO) at the path specified
# in the configuration. After it has been successfully opened,
# you can redirect any program’s output into the FIFO, causing
# Cinch to paste the output into all IRC channels it currently
# is in.
#
# == Dependencies
# * Gem: mkfifo
# * A POSIX-conforming operating system. This definitely
#   excludes Microsoft Windows.
#
# == Configuration
# Add the following to your bot’s configure.do stanza:
#
#   config.plugins.options[Cinch::Fifo] = {
#     :path => "/tmp/irc",
#     :mode => 0666
#   }
#
# [path]
#   Where to open the named pipe. Cinch must have write
#   access to the directory containing this file.
# [mode]
#   File mode to set on the pipe. Depending on who you
#   want to be able to write to the pipe you may choose
#   anything from 0666 (read-write for anybody) to
#   0200 (write-only for the owner). See chmod(1) for
#   possible modes (and beware the leading zero, this is
#   usually an octal number).
