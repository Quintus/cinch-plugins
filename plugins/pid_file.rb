# = Cinch PID file plugin
# This plugin is useful if you want to run Cinch as a daemon
# process. It creates a file containing Cinch’s process
# identifier (PID) when connecting to an IRC server, and deletes
# it on disconnection.
#
# == Dependencies
# None.
#
# == Configuration
# Add the following to your bot’s configure.do stanza:
#
#   config.plugins.options[Cinch::PidFile] = {
#     :path   => "/run/orrbot.pid,
#     :strict => true
#   }
#
# [path]
#   Where you want to have the PID file created. The directory
#   must be writable by Cinch.
# [strict (true)]
#   If this is true (the default), Cinch will refuse to start
#   if the PID file already exists, as this usually means that
#   another instance of Cinch is already running, but this may
#   also be the result of a kill-9 or the like. If you don’t
#   want this behaviour, simply set this option to false.
