# = Cinch Quit plugin
# A really simple plugin for making your Cinch bot leave the
# IRC. Just issue a +quit+ command to him and he will leave;
# optionally only ops can do this.
#
# == Dependencies
# None.
#
# == Configuration
# Add the following to your bot’s configure.do stanza:
#
#   config.plugins.options[Cinch::Quit] = {
#     :op => false
#   }
#
# [op]
#   If enabled, the +quit+ command can only be issued by someone
#   who has operator privileges in the channel he issues the command
#   in; additionally, if this option is enabled, the +quit+ command
#   can only be issued publicely in a channel and is ignored if
#   received via PM.
