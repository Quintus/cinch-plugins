# = Cinch Memo plugin
# This plugin enables Cinch to remember short memo messages for
# someone who currently isn’t in the channel or even online.
# Supports both public per-channel memos and private memos,
# where the latter are only delivered to people who identified
# against NickServ (Cinch currently supports this functionality
# currently officially only on FreeNode and QuakeNet).
#
# == Configuration
# Add the following to your bot’s configure.do stanza:
#
#   config.plugins.options[Cinch::Memo] = {
#     :max_lifetime => 7
#   }
#
# [max_lifetime (7)]
#   Cinch doesn’t remember memos for infinity, because this
#   may badly impact your sever’s memory usage, depending on
#   how aggressive users are when storing memos into Cinch.
#   Therefore, each memo is assigned a lifetime value, starting
#   at the value specified via this configuration option. Every
#   half an hour, Cinch decreases each memo’s lifetime by one,
#   and if any memo’s lifetime reaches the value 0 (zero), Cinch
#   silently discards the memo (a message will be printed to the
#   log on debug level, though). If the target nick joins while
#   the memo is still valid, it will also be deleted from the
#   list of memos after having been delivered, of course.

cinch memo for <nick>: <message>
  Makes me remember a notice for <nick>. When <nick> joins the
  channel, I’ll post <message> indicating you told me to do so.
  If <nick> doesn’t join for a long time, I’ll discard the memo.
/msg cinch memo for <nick>: <message>
  Makes me remember a private notice for <nick>. When <nick> comes
  online and identifies against NickServ, I'll send him <message>
  privately. I discard the memo if <nick> doesn't connect for a long time.
