Hi #{nick},

your nick has been mentioned on IRC by #{msg.user.nick} in
#{msg.channel.name}. Here’s the exact message:

#{msg.user.nick} at #{message.time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %:z')}:
> #{msg.message}

If you do no longer wish to receive this notifications, issue

  /msg #{bot.nick} stopmail

once you have authenticated against NickServ.
